    "Description":  "This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, \"Exchange Server zero-days exploited in the wild\".\nIn early March 2021, Microsoft released patches for four different zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Exchange Server. The vulnerabilities were being used in a coordinated attack. For more information on the vulnerabilities, visit the following links:\n1. CVE-2021-26855\n2. CVE-2021-26857\n3. CVE-2021-26858\n4. CVE-2021-27065\nThe following query looks for evidence of Procdump being used to dump credentials from LSASS, the Local Security Authentication Server. This might indicate an attacker has compromised user accounts.\nMore queries related to this threat can be found under the See also section of this page.\nReference - https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/02/multiple-security-updates-released-for-exchange-server/",
